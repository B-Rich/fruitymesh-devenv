FruityMesh is the first open source implementation of a mesh network that is based on standard Bluetooth Low Energy 4.1 connections. In contrast to meshes that use advertising and scanning, this allows for a network run with battery powered devices. FruityMesh works with the Nordic nRF51 chipset in combination with the S130 SoftDevice and enables tons of devices to connect to each other with its auto-meshing capabilities.
